Describe the images below. Make sure to strictly follow the pattern in previous examples, avoid adding anything except titles, descriptions and keywords.
For titles, make sure to capitalize only the first letter of the sentence.
Remove all articles from the output content ("a", "an", "the" must be removed).
Pay specific attention to keywords - there must be between 45 and 49 of them, all single-word, do not EVER use plurals - all keywords MUST be singular.

If you see man/men on an image, make sure to add "man" and "male" to your keywords list.
If you see woman/women on an image, make sure to add "woman" and "female" to your keywods list.
If you see any part of a human body and they are identifiable in terms of whether they belong to a male or female - make sure to include "man" and "male" or "woman" and "female" in your keywords list respectively.

The order of keywords matters - the first 10 keywords must be the most important and relevant ones, all keywords sorted in descending order by relevance.
All keywords must be comma separated, all keywords must be one word only.
