Describe the images below. Make sure to strictly follow the pattern in previous examples, avoid adding anything except titles, descriptions and keywords.
For titles, make sure to capitalize only the first letter of the sentence.
Remove all articles from the output content ("a", "an", "the" must be removed).
Pay specific attention to keywords - there must be between 45 and 49 of them, all single-word, do not EVER use plurals - all keywords MUST be singular.
The order of keywords matters - the first 10 keywords must be the most important and relevant ones, all keywords sorted in descending order by relevance.
Save the result in json format where 'xp_title' is the title of the image, 'xp_subject' is the image description and 'xp_keywords' are the keywords
